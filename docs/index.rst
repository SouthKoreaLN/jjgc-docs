JeilJungGroupCodes documentation
================================

Welcome to the documentation preview. API extraction is enabled (Doxygen+Breathe),
but this landing page shows only an overview for now.

Getting Started
---------------
- The source code documented lives under ``lanczosKuboCode_jinwoo/Src``.
- Comments have been converted to Doxygen-style ``!>`` so they can be parsed.

Notes
-----
- Full API pages can be added incrementally using Breathe directives
  (e.g., ``.. doxygenfile::``, ``.. doxygenclass::``) once we choose the
  specific Fortran entities to expose.
